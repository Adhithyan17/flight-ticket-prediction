# Flight Ticket Prediction Project
Welcome to the Flight Ticket Prediction Project repository! This project aims to predict flight ticket prices using machine learning techniques. The project follows a structured approach, covering various stages from data collection to model deployment.

## Project Overview
### Business Understanding
Understand the goal of predicting flight ticket prices and its potential impact on travelers, airlines, and other stakeholders.

### Data Collection
Gather flight data from various sources, including APIs, web scraping, and public datasets.

### Data Preparation
- Clean the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Perform feature engineering to create relevant features that can improve model performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore the dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between different variables.

### Model Building
Train machine learning models for predicting flight ticket prices using various techniques:
- Classification (if applicable)
- Regression
- Clustering (if applicable)

### Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of trained models using appropriate metrics and techniques.

### Model Deployment
Integrate the trained model into a production environment:
- Considerations for serving the model efficiently and scalability.
- Set up infrastructure for hosting the model.
